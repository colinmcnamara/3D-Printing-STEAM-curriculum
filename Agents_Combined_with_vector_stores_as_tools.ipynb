        "\n",
        "The recommended method for doing so is to create a RetrievalQA and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vectorstores as normal tools, or you can set return_direct=True to really just use the agent as a router."
